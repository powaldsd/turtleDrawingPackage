# turtleDrawingPackage

Requirements:
	(Really Important)-U need to know python basics
	(Important)-U need to know how moduls work
	(Not that important)-U need to know how to change code view this folder
if u are not well in math and just a begginer for math in programming use just Draw() function
Also important if u are well in math for programming or math in general

now first u need to import module by typing:
	import drawings

	#now this will be python code u can just copy paste this

	#first u need to accsess class draw by typing

drawings.draw #or this will work draw = drawings.draw so u dont have to all drawings all the time
drawings.draw.draw(100, 90, 4, 8) 

	#To Understand how this works u will need to open file drawing.py with notepad or your text editor
	#I mean u are going to need drawings.py for this to work but make sure to view modul first
	
	#If everything went succssesfull u should have a square

for advanced users u just need to view drawings.py thats all (: (or wach the video that will come soon to how to use this and how it works)
